# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 11: September 17, 2020
Finally came up with a simple design that I'm happy with. Works well for the project pages and satisfies my criteria to showcase the main project as well as show work chronologically. 

## Day 2-10: September 8-16, 2020

Been working on design improvements for the portfolio mostly in Figma. Came up with 5 iterations of design. Still not happy with the layout. Think I will take a break and go back to working on the content to start with and then come back to the layout.

## Day 1: September 7, 2020

Improved the card grid and created card component. I need more structure to keep this going. Maybe need to start doing coding puzzles to keep me on track.

## Day 0: September 6, 2020

Restarted by working on home page designs. Came up with 4 iterations. Added card grid component.

## Day 6: August 27, 2020

Custom link styling inside tabs - was complex figuring out how to use useRouteMatch hook. Apparently it doesn't work in callbacks. 

## Day 5: August 26, 2020

So I learnt today that react doesn't encapsulate styles like angular does. So I have to rely on global styles and a good class name scheme. Continued on design system and created new base components.

## Day 4: August 25, 2020

Added design system: css vars for color and type. Also added stories for design system.

## Day 3: August 20, 2020

Created a common component for tabs for routing. Learnt how to do lists (equivalent to ngFor but uses ES6).

## Day 2: August 19, 2020

Setup ESlinting and Prettier in the repo. (Harder than I thought it would be). Setup GHPages to support routing with ReactRouter. Also worked on typography and mobile design ideas.

## Day 1: August 18, 2020

Learnt about props, state and events. Also about binding events in ES6 classes. Started design system theme in Figma.

## Day 0: August 17, 2020

Learnt component types in React. Created a class component for button and added stories.

## Day 1: August 13, 2020

Setup deployment for mainapp using ghpages CLI. Also setup deploy scripts. Woot. Tried accessing repo using stackblitz but seems like there are integration issues with storybook.

## Day 0: August 12, 2020

Today's Progress: Created a new repo to work on my 2020 portfolio. Setup a React and Typescript app. Setup Storybook and added npm commands to deploy/static host storybook in the storybook repo.

Thoughts: I really struggled with setting up a repo and framework from scratch. Although most of my struggles came from trying to figure out how to run npx on windows. I finally gave up and went back to using regular npm. I also spent longer than I planned to today. But I realised a lot of my foundational knowledge from setting up Angular apps still apply. I also learnt that React doesnt have inbuilt routing like angular does. Intersting
