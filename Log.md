# 100 Days Of Code - Log
## Day 0: August 12, 2020
Today's Progress: Created a new repo to work on my 2020 portfolio. Setup a React and Typescript app. Setup Storybook and added npm commands to deploy/static host storybook in the storybook repo.

Thoughts: I really struggled with setting up a repo and framework from scratch. Although most of my struggles came from trying to figure out how to run npx on windows. I finally gave up and went back to using regular npm. I also spent longer than I planned to today. But I realised a lot of my foundational knowledge from setting up Angular apps still apply. I also learnt that React doesnt have inbuilt routing like angular does. Intersting
